####Off-topic:
I'd like to mention that previously I did test using Selenide hence I do understand that not all assertions are on their place. 
This is something that should be improved.

At the same time I wasn't tried to cover and test everything because:
* I respect your time, because you'll check it and spend your own time;
* I respect my time, I believe what you'll see is enough for your understanding - if not, let's talk :)
* There is no borderline of success story here, I mean during development I all the time found places for improvement. In the end I won't finish it in time if I start to make it better over and over again :)
